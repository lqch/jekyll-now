Hello there! 
I am working on tiny planktonic snails, called pteropods *(winged-foots)* that live all over the world's oceans. I want to find out how the pteropods in one part of the ocean are connected to those in another part, whether they mix around with other pteropods in space. I do this to find out if they have enough diversity in them to be resilient to future changes. **Go pteros!**

### Find out more about pteropods 

See them flap around in the video below! There are two types of pteropods, sea-butterflies and sea-angels. Sea-butterflies have shells, whereas sea-angels don't and are 'naked'. Sea-butterflies use their mucus net to trap small food particles and slurp them up. Sea-angels look gentle and angelic, but they eat sea-butterflies! *shudders*

Sea-butterflies have extremely thin shells that can dissolve easily, especially due to [ocean acidification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_acidification) that is happening as you read this. This is why it is important to study them.
